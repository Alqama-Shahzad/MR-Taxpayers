    question: "What's the difference between NTN and STRN?",
    answer: "NTN (National Tax Number) is required for all taxpayers and is used for income tax purposes. STRN (Sales Tax Registration Number) is specifically for businesses that need to collect and pay sales tax. Most businesses need both, but the requirements depend on your annual turnover and business type."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does NTN registration take?",
    answer: "With proper documentation, NTN registration typically takes 3-5 business days. We handle all the paperwork and FBR interactions to ensure a smooth process. Emergency processing is available for urgent cases."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to file tax returns if I'm salaried?",
    answer: "Yes, if your annual income exceeds PKR 600,000, you're required to file an annual income tax return. Even if your employer deducts tax at source, filing a return is mandatory and helps you claim any refunds due."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need for STRN registration?",
    answer: "For STRN registration, you'll need: valid NTN, CNIC/passport copies, business registration documents, bank account details, and proof of business address. We'll provide a complete checklist based on your specific business type."
  },
  {
